# Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. By analyzing customer data, the model aims to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition, enabling businesses to implement proactive retention strategies.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which includes various customer attributes such as demographics, account information, and services subscribed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed to understand the data distribution, identify missing values, and uncover relationships between features and the target variable (churn).

3. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * **Handling Missing Values**: Addressed any missing or inconsistent data entries.
   * **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Converted categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like Label Encoding.
   * **Feature Scaling**: Normalized numerical features to ensure uniformity across the dataset.

4. **Train-Test Split**: Divided the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.

5. **Machine Learning Models**:

   * **Random Forest Classifier**: Utilized for its robustness and ability to handle complex interactions.
   * **Decision Tree Classifier**: Helps in interpretable classification tasks.
   * **XGBoost Classifier**: Boosts accuracy with optimized gradient boosting technique.

6. **Model Evaluation**:

   * **Accuracy Score**: Measured the proportion of correct predictions.
   * **Confusion Matrix**: Analyzed true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
   * **Classification Report**: Assessed precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.

7. **Prediction on Unknown Data**: Applied the best-performing model to new, unseen data to predict customer churn likelihood.

## Key Findings

* **Churn Rate**: Identified the overall churn rate within the dataset.
* **Influential Factors**:

  * **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts showed higher churn rates compared to long-term contracts.
  * **Tenure**: Customers with shorter tenure were more likely to churn.
  * **Payment Method**: Electronic check payments were associated with higher churn.
  * **Monthly Charges**: Higher monthly charges correlated with increased churn probability.

## Technologies Used

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries**:

  * **Data Manipulation**: Pandas, NumPy
  * **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  * **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
  * **SMOTE**: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a popular technique used to address class imbalance in datasets, particularly in classification problems. Instead of simply duplicating minority class instances, SMOTE generates new synthetic samples by interpolating between existing minority class examples. This helps create a more balanced class distribution, improving the performance of machine learning models by reducing bias toward the majority class and allowing the model to learn patterns from the minority class more effectively.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict customer churn. By identifying key factors influencing churn, businesses can tailor their strategies to enhance customer retention.
